# Debugging "No Results Found" Issue

## Changes Made:

I've added debug logging to help identify the problem. When you search now, you'll see logs in the terminal showing:

1. **The search URL being used**
2. **The API response status code**
3. **The full API response body**
4. **Number of results found**
5. **Any API errors**

## How to Debug:

### Step 1: Check the Terminal Logs
After you perform a search in the app, look at the terminal output. You should see:

```
Searching for: batman
Searching URL: https://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=54844d50&s=batman
Response status: 200
Response body: {...}
Found X results
```

### Step 2: Common Issues & Solutions:

#### Issue 1: API Key Invalid or Expired
**Symptoms:** Error message like "Invalid API key"
**Solution:** Get a new API key from https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx

#### Issue 2: Daily Limit Reached
**Symptoms:** Error message like "Request limit reached"
**Solution:** The free tier has 1,000 requests/day. Wait 24 hours or upgrade.

#### Issue 3: No Internet Connection
**Symptoms:** Error: "Error searching movies. Check your internet connection."
**Solution:** Check your device's internet connection

#### Issue 4: Search Query Too Specific
**Symptoms:** "No results found"
**Solution:** Try broader search terms like:
- ✅ "batman" instead of "batman begins 2005"
- ✅ "avengers" instead of "the avengers endgame"
- ✅ "star wars" instead of "star wars a new hope"

### Step 3: Test with Known Movies

Try searching for these movies that definitely exist:
- "batman"
- "superman"
- "avengers"
- "titanic"
- "inception"

If these don't work, it's an API or connection issue.

### Step 4: Verify API Key

Test your API key directly in a browser:
```
http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=54844d50&s=batman
```

You should see JSON with search results. If you see an error, the API key might be invalid.

## Improvements Made:

1. ✅ **Better error messages** - Shows specific reasons (no results, connection error, etc.)
2. ✅ **Debug logging** - See exactly what's happening in the terminal
3. ✅ **Visual error display** - Icon + message for better UX
4. ✅ **Empty query validation** - Prompts user to enter search term
5. ✅ **Clear search state** - Resets results before each search

## Next Steps:

1. Run the app
2. Try searching for "batman"
3. Check the terminal for debug logs
4. Share the logs with me if there's still an issue

## Quick Test:

To verify the API is working, run this in your browser:
```
http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=54844d50&s=test
```

If you see results, the API works and the issue is in the app connection.
