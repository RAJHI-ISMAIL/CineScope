## API Information

This app uses the [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to fetch movie and TV series data.

**API Endpoints Used:**
- Search: `https://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey={key}&s={query}`
- Details: `https://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey={key}&i={imdbID}&plot=full`

## Dependencies

- `http: ^1.1.0` - For API requests
- `cupertino_icons: ^1.0.8` - iOS-style icons

## Notes

- The free OMDB API tier has a limit of 1,000 requests per day
- **Important**: You must verify your API key via email before it becomes active
- Internet connection is required for the app to work
- The app includes debug logging for troubleshooting API issues
- Star ratings are calculated from IMDb scores (10-point scale converted to 5 stars)

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API key" Error
1. Make sure you've verified your email from OMDB
2. Check that you've copied the API key correctly to `omdb_api_service.dart`
3. Wait a few minutes after verification before testing

### No Results Found
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try a different search term (e.g., "Batman", "Breaking Bad")
